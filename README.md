# TreeVariants
This is my first JavaScript project that will feature variants of fractal trees.
## Object Oriented Fractal Trees
The very first variant will be an object oriented fractal tree. Inside the code for the treenode object, is commented out alternate code which results in mutated fractal trees. Pictures of the results are in a folder, a variant resembling solar panels is displayed below.

The nature of object oriented fractal trees allows it to be very easily distorted and pop out at the viewer. Turning distort on with exactly after clicking create a new branch 5 times or 6 times produces two unique rotational interactions.

The code uses p5.js
