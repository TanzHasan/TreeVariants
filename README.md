# TreeVariants
This is my first JavaScript project that will feature variants of fractal trees.
## Object Oriented Fractal Trees
The very first variant will be an object oriented fractal tree. Inside the code for the treenode object, is commented out alternate code which results in mutated fractal trees. Pictures of the results are in a folder. 

The nature of this variant of fractal tree allows it to be very easily distorted and pop out at the viewer.

### Resources
The code uses p5.js
